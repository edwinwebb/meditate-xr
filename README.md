# Meditation XR
A compact WebXR experience using React Three Fiber and friends 

Consider the sun, lifebringer, chariot to the gods, whose presence causes day and whose absence causes night

Consider the moon, home to the rabbit and the buffalo, bringer of tides and suns reflection

Meditate on the these things
